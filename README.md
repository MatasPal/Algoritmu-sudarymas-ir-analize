# Algorithm Design and Analysis

## Description

This repository is dedicated to the **Algorithm Design and Analysis** module's laboratory work, which was completed during studies at KTU. This module focuses on the development of algorithms, their efficiency analysis, and practical application in solving various problems.

## Content

The laboratory work covers the following topics:

- **Search algorithms**
- **Sorting algorithms**
- **Recursion**
- **Dynamic programming**
- **Complexity analysis (Big-O notation)**
- **Graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path search)**
- **Heuristic and greedy algorithms**

Each directory contains the tasks from laboratory work, code implementations, and their analysis.
